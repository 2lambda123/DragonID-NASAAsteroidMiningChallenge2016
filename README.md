### Sensing Your Opportunities in Space

In the very near future, asteroid mining may become one of the primary ways to succesfully fuel the outward expansion of humankind, and the continued exploration of space. With both goverment and commerical entities showing a renewed interest in space, it has become clear that the expense of bringing materials up to orbit is financially untenable for signifiacnt space-bound operataions; and so the race for identifying potential asteroids for mining, being able to analyize them, and then deploying mining equipment and/or the ability to change their orbits is heating up.

In addition, the continued potential for an _Angry Asteroid_, an asteroid with the ability to cause widespread damage to the Earth and humans haunts us like never before! The same techniques that can be developed for commercial mining of an asteroid could instead be redirected to saving humankind from destruction.

Drawing on our team’s diverse background in design, programming, engineering, and economics we created a modularized system that has the following abilities:

1. Using existing infrastructure to identify key potential resources from near Earth/Moon objects (*NEMO's*).
  - We also propose theoretical technologies and locations to identify NEMO's in the future.
2. Sending out a low cost delivery vehicle on an intercept path that will release.
  1. The Dragonfly Cluster, a set of modular, medium-production satellites that are designed to cluster around a potential prospecting target and closely analyze it at various altitudes for mineralogical composition data.
  2. The Javelin, a ‘telescopic’ mini-bore module that is designed to uncompact during flight, and then embed itself in the soft regolith of the asteroid for further analysis.
3. Reusing the Javelins as anchors for orbital maneuvering in order to bring it around the moon or a Lagrange Point
4. Reusing the Dragonflys as mining operation sensor units.
5. Then based on the composition of the asteroid, a mining rig can be set-up for extraction and local processing ([see Star-Whals Project for potential methods](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/solar-system/asteroid-mining/projects/ne-asteroid-mining "Star-Whals")).

Team Dragonfly's methods, STL files, electronics, pictures, presentation, and in in-depth disucssion on what it will take for asteroid mining this to be succesfull (economics, sensors, etc...) is presented here in full, Open Sourced (MIT License), and available for anyone to interact with, or improve.

The best place to start is the The 30-second video found on [YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TvAWDsC62I). For a more in-depth view, our presentation [PPTX with video (recommended)](https://github.com/DragonID/NASA3DMedDevice2015/blob/master/C%C3%A6l%C3%A9stis%20Presentation.pptx), or [PDF](https://github.com/DragonID/NASA3DMedDevice2015/blob/master/C%C3%A6l%C3%A9stis%20Presentation.pdf) is the next stop.

Comprehensive information is available in the detailed write-up below.

    Thank you,
