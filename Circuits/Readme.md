#### Sensors and Circuits

In order to show a proof-of-concept that sensors can be obtained, programmed, and installed on a modern micro-sat, we used an Arduino with off-the-shelf sensors. The videos, circuits, and 3D files for the sensors are found in this folder. As a thought exercise, and a practical exercise it shows that the sensors proposed in the main Readme are plausible to create and configure on a small scale, with the caveat that space will require special hardening.
